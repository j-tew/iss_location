# ISS Locator App
### Find where the International Space Station is flying over while orbiting Earth
This is a simple Flask App that uses the Open Notify [ISS Current Location](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/) and [People in Space](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/) APIs to show the ground location of the ISS and a list of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft. 

### The skills I applied to this project:
- Flask framework
- Jinja templating
- Basic front end UI/UX with HTML and CSS
- Interacting with an API
- Parsing JSON with Python
